# Codex Weixin Middleware

This project is a lightweight middleware that connects Codex to pluggable chat channels. Weixin is the first channel adapter, implemented by adapting the communication capability extracted from `@tencent-weixin/openclaw-weixin`.

This project is OpenClaw-free at runtime. It must not depend on OpenClaw CLI, OpenClaw gateway, OpenClaw host runtime, or OpenClaw channel runtime. The `openclaw-weixin` package is only used as the Weixin communication reference and adaptation source.

## Current Status

- Node.js + TypeScript project scaffold is in place.
- The official npm package archive is stored under `openclaw-weixin-npm/`.
- A generic `ChannelAdapter` protocol is implemented so future channels can reuse the same bridge core.
- Mock, Terminal, and Weixin channel adapters are implemented.
- Bridge Core, command routing, approval management, memory state, and baseline logging are implemented.
- The `codex exec --json` adapter is implemented and has been verified through the terminal channel with the real Codex CLI.
- Weixin QR login, local account token persistence, text send, and basic `getupdates` polling support are implemented.
- The `weixin codex` startup entry checks Codex availability and Weixin login state. It skips QR login when credentials are valid and starts QR login when credentials are missing.
- The `weixin codex` daemon terminal prints inbound Weixin messages and outbound Codex replies so the running conversation can be observed locally.
- History session lists prefer Codex SQLite titles or first user messages, then fall back to `session_index.jsonl` and rollout metadata.

## Commands

```bash
npm test
npm run cli:mock
npm run cli:terminal:mock
npm run cli:terminal:codex
npm run cli:weixin:status
npm run cli:weixin:login
npm run cli:weixin:codex
```

Real Codex mode supports startup options:

```bash
npm run cli:terminal:codex -- --session new --permission approval --cwd ./workspaces/demo
npm run cli:weixin:codex -- --session last --permission approval
```

- `--session new|last|<id>`: create a new session, resume the latest session, or bind a specific Codex session.
- `--cwd <dir>` / `--workdir <dir>`: used only for new sessions. Missing directories are created automatically.
- `--permission approval|full`: choose approval mode or full permission mode.
- `--yes-dangerously-full`: non-interactive confirmation for full permission mode. Full mode bypasses approvals and sandboxing and is high risk.

During interactive startup, choosing a new session displays the default working directory. If the user enters a missing directory, the middleware creates it. If an existing session is selected, the middleware uses the working directory recorded in that Codex session history.

The current `codex exec --json` mode can reuse Codex history sessions, but it does not live-sync Weixin-side interaction into another already-open Codex CLI or Codex App window. Real-time multi-view synchronization needs a later app-server/event-subscription adapter, or a middleware-owned observer UI where the middleware is the single session entry point.

Normal messages from the same channel context are processed sequentially. If Codex is already running and another normal message arrives, the middleware replies with a queued notice; commands such as `/status`, `/cancel`, and approval commands still run immediately. Current progress updates come from events visible in `codex exec --json`, including turn start, reasoning summaries, command/tool/file-change summaries, and final replies. Finer same-turn steering needs a later app-server adapter.

## Channel Commands

- `/help`: show available commands.
- `/new`: create a new Codex session for the current channel context.
- `/status`: show Bridge, channel, Codex, session, and working directory status.
- `/sessions`: list sessions known to the current channel context.
- `/sessions all` or `/all-sessions`: list all discoverable Codex history session IDs.
- `/resume <session>` / `/use <session>`: resume and bind a Codex session.
- `/approve <id>`, `/approve-session <id>`, `/deny <id>`, `/cancel [id]`: handle Codex approvals or cancel the current task.
